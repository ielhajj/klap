# Instructions for Setting up the KLAP Runtime

## Overview

The KLAP runtime is a header-only library containing a set of helper functions that the compiler transformations use. Some of these helper functions depend on CUB, so CUB must be obtained first.

## Instructions for obtaining CUB

Clone CUB from github as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/cub.git
```
